Why are you here?

I don't want to eat you.  I don't want to eat anybody.  It's just I get so hungry.  I'm too big.

Really?

I can.

You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you?  That's why they sent you here.

Karl.

You don't like it?

Okay.

What did she say?

You know anyone's who's taken it?

You're not trying to run away?

What happened to your shoes?

Karl.
