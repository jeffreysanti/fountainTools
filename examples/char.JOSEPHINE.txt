Allo oui?

Yes, he's here.

It's your mother.

It's bad.

You need to go.

I'm going with you.

I'm going with you.

It's good to see you.  You look beautiful.

Yes.

To the day.

I spent a week in Morocco for the story.  It was incredible.

Really.

Hi.  How are you feeling?

What were you dreaming about?

That's terrible.

No, I understand.

Stop.

Can I take your picture?

Please?

O.S.
I have photos from the wedding to show you.  There's a great one of you and my father.  I had an extra print made.

O.S.
I want to see pictures of your wedding.  I've never seen any.

I never knew.

Oh, so this is a tall tale?

I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.

O.S.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?

You were talking about your wedding.

I like your stories.

I talked with your father last night.

You never told me how your parents met.

What about the details?  How they fell in love.  The Circus.  The War.  You never told me any of that.

But it's romantic.

Mmm, what?

Do you love your father?

Do you love him?

But it's not true.

You're not.

I am always on your side.  And I think you should talk to him.

The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car.

I'll help you.

I need to lie down for a bit.

O.S.
Will!

Your father had a stroke.  He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.

No.  He won't.  I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.  It seems every hour I have to...

I do.

Don't stop.  Don't.
