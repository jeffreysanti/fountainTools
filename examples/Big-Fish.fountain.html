<p class='action'>This is The Beast.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.  They're just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn't worried.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He'd taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, I'd tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired.</p>

<p class='action'>Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.  She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma.  He's hypnotizing.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.  And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.</p>

<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.  I looked him straight in the eye.  And I made a remarkable discovery.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, I was in a situation.  I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Will can't take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn't even notice.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(closer; he holds up his ring)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>VARIOUS TOWNFOLK</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Find yourself a nice girl!  Don't trust anyone in Kentucky!  Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>THE OLD WOMAN.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.</p>

<p class='action'>We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.  Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't.  People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.</p>

<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>That poet, Norther Winslow did.  He was going to Paris, France.  He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.</p>
<p class='parenthetical'>(beat)</p>
<p class='dialogue'>Tell you what.  You take the other way and I'll cut through here.  Meet you on the far side.</p>

<p class='scene-heading'>EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>He looks back the way he came.  It's tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>FURTHER ALONG</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='character'>EDWARD</p>
<p class='dialogue'>You stupid sonofa...</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST.  The swarm roars out.</p>

<p class='dialogue'>There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.</p>

<p class='action'>Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.</p>
<br class='padding' />
<p class='action'>Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.</p>
