<br /><span class='dialogue'>looked him straight in the</span>

<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>INT.  TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT</span>
<br /><span class='scene-heading'>(1998)</span>

<br /><span class='action'>This is their wedding reception, crowded with their</span>

<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>This fish, the Beast.  The</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>whole time we were calling it</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>a him, when in fact it was a</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>her.  It was fat with eggs,</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>and was going to lay them any</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>day.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned</span>
<br /><span class='action'>from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn't</span>
<br /><span class='action'>be any happier if this were her own wedding.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Now, I was in a situation.  I</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>could gut that fish and get</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>my ring back, but doing so I</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>would be killing the smartest</span>

<br /><span class='dialogue'>soon to be mother of a</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>hundred others.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will can't take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him</span>
<br /><span class='action'>back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn't even</span>
<br /><span class='action'>notice.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD (CONT'D)</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Did I want to deprive my</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>soon-to-be-born son the</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>chance to catch a fish like</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>this of his own?  This lady</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>fish and I, well, we had the</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>same destiny.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his</span>
<br /><span class='action'>father--</span>
<br /><br /><br />
<span class='character'>EDWARD AND WILL</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>We were part of the same</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>equation.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts</span>
<br /><span class='action'>him.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>SANDRA</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Honey, it's still your night.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will can't articulate his anger.  He just leaves.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Now, you may well ask, since</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>this lady fish wasn't the</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>ghost of a thief, why did it</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>strike so quick on gold when</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>nothing else would attract</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>it?</span>

<br /><span class='dialogue'>That was the lesson I learned</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>that day, the day my son was</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>born.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is -- and</span>
<br /><span class='action'>has always been -- about her more than anyone.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Sometimes, the only way to</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>catch an uncatchable woman is</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>to offer her a wedding ring.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>A LAUGH from the crowd.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.  As</span>
<br /><span class='action'>she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage</span>
<br /><span class='action'>has not lessened their affection for each other.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little</span>
<br /><span class='action'>way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well</span>
<br /><span class='action'>for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.</span>

<br /><span class='action'>anymore -- there's no space between the drops.  It's</span>
<br /><span class='action'>like being caught in a waterfall.  It's that loud.</span>
<br /><br /><br />
<span class='action'>No choice, Edward stops the car.  Puts on the</span>
<br /><span class='action'>handbrake.  Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no</span>
<br /><span class='action'>longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.  The world is</span>
<br /><span class='action'>close and echoing, because --</span>

<br /><span class='action'>fine.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>She's swimming outside the car.  While we never see</span>

<br /><span class='action'>an unearthly glow.  She's more tranquil and more</span>
<br /><span class='action'>beautiful than we've ever seen her.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>My girl in the river.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>She kisses him.  He tweaks her chin.  The crowd</span>
<br /><span class='action'>HOLLERS in approval, but their moment remains</span>
<br /><span class='action'>strangely private.  Only Will is there to witness.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding</span>
<br /><span class='action'>ring.  But it's stuck.  Finally, he sucks on it,</span>
<br /><span class='action'>pulling it free with his teeth.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold.  Will</span>
<br /><span class='action'>takes the ring out of his mouth.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a</span>
<br /><span class='action'>SPLASH.  For he's no longer a man, but rather</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>A FAT CATFISH</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>swimming at his feet.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper</span>
<br /><span class='action'>water, disappearing.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water,</span>
<br /><span class='action'>watching Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight.</span>
<br /><span class='action'>Josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire</span>
<br /><span class='action'>crowd.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...</span>
<br /><br /><br />
<span class='action'>Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the</span>
<br /><span class='action'>water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset.  It</span>
<br /><span class='action'>then dives back under with a SPLASH.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='transition'>CROSSFADE</span>
<br /><span class='transition'>BACK TO:</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>WILL</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>You become what you always</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>were.  A very big fish.</span>
<br /><span class='parenthetical'>(he smiles)</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>And that's the way it</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>happens.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>EDWARD</span>
<br /><span class='parenthetical'>(a whisper)</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Yes.  Exactly.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Edward smiles, proud of both of them.   His eyes are</span>
<br /><span class='action'>so pale and so open, we can almost see his soul.  In</span>
<br /><span class='action'>every atom of his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom</span>
<br /><span class='action'>is entirely happy.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>And this is how he goes.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him.</span>
<br /><span class='action'>The walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>He finds a quarter, starts to dial.  He has to squint</span>
<br /><span class='action'>to see through the water in his eyes.   It's ringing.</span>
<br /><span class='action'>And ringing.  The other end answers.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='character'>WILL</span>
<br /><span class='parenthetical'>(voice cracking)</span>
<br /><span class='dialogue'>Hi.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside</span>
<br /><span class='action'>him.  He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield</span>
<br /><span class='action'>himself.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next</span>
<br /><span class='action'>passage.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>INT.  HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come</span>
<br /><span class='action'>off the elevator.</span>
<br /><br /><br />
<span class='scene-heading'>INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight</span>
<br /><span class='action'>in.  She strips the bed.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>INT.  BEDROOM - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for</span>
<br /><span class='action'>Will to wear at the funeral.  Will tries to button the</span>
<br /><span class='action'>cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind</span>
<br /><span class='action'>that need links.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying</span>
<br /><span class='action'>to find a matching pair.  Further down, he finds a</span>
<br /><span class='action'>ribbon tied to</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>THE KEY TO THE CITY.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>He smiles, disbelieving.  It's a real thing.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Will helps his mother out of a black sedan.  She's</span>
<br /><span class='action'>well-composed, not nearly the wreck we might have</span>
<br /><span class='action'>expected.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his</span>
<br /><span class='action'>WIFE.  The service is crowded, more than 200 people,</span>
<br /><span class='action'>many more than expected.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left</span>
<br /><span class='action'>to see an Oldsmobile parking.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>CLOSE ON the license plates.  Missouri.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is</span>
<br /><span class='action'>barely visible over the door.  He shuts it to reveal</span>
<br /><span class='action'>himself to be 70.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>It's Amos Calloway.  Will doesn't recognize him.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel.</span>
<br /><span class='action'>We TILT UP to see this man is huge.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>This man is KARL, now 55.  He's not 12 feet tall, but</span>
<br /><span class='action'>at least six-eight.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really</span>
<br /><span class='action'>exists.</span>
<br /><br /><br />
<span class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his</span>
<br /><span class='action'>mother to a seat near the grave.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN</span>
<br /><span class='action'>WOMAN (50) behind them.  A beat later, an identical</span>
<br /><span class='action'>face with glasses peers out -- the woman's twin</span>
<br /><span class='action'>sister.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>It's PING and JING.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>Josephine almost GASPS.  She elbows Will, who turns to</span>
<br /><span class='action'>look.  From this angle, the sisters seem conjoined,</span>
<br /><span class='action'>but then Jing steps forward.  They're really two</span>
<br /><span class='action'>separate people.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the</span>
<br /><span class='action'>years:  BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY</span>
<br /><span class='action'>PRICE.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class='scene-heading'>EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small</span>
<br /><span class='action'>groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see</span>
<br /><span class='action'>they're telling stories.  They're telling Edward's</span>
<br /><span class='action'>stories.</span>
<br /><br /><span class='action'>We find Will watching them.</span>
