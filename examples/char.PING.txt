*Sometimes a girl can feel so alone
Without a lover to call her own.
Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to explode.
Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes.*

*But she won't.
No, she can't.
She needs a special **special** different unusual man.
Because that girl,
Who looks like me,
She has wants, but she has needs.*

Any of you got needs?

*I've had twice the adventure,
Cried double the tears.
Two times the bad times in half the years.
I need a strong man, because I've got
Twice the love to give.*

Say hello, Jing.

I'm Ping.  She's Jing.  She's the good one.

I'm the bad one.

How could you miss your cue?  You make me look like a fool, out there alone.

Who the hell are you?

Damn right you're not.

GUARD!

What makes you think we'll help you?

And what are we supposed to do when we get to America?

He's here!
