Welcome to ya.  What's your name?

Bloom like a flower?

Oh.  Here!  Right here.  Edward Bloom.  We weren't expecting you yet.

Not yet.

Mmm-hmm.  Life'll do that to you.  And truthfully, the long way _is_ easier, but it's longer.

And you're here now, and that's what matters.

The town of Spectre.  Best kept secret in Alabama.   Says here you're from Ashton, right?  Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

He's still here.  Let me buy you a drink.  I'll tell you all about it.  Hell, I'll have him tell you.

Son, I already told you.  You're early.

Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.

He is our poet laureate.

Why?

No one's ever left.

You won't find a better place!
