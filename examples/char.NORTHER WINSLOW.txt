Everything here tastes better.  Even the water is sweet.  Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.  At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.

There is no softer ground than town.

I've been working on this poem for 12 years.

There's a lot of expectation.  I don't want to disappoint my fans.

This is why you don't show work in progress.

I can't imagine any place better than here.

It's me.  Norther Winslow.

I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes.  There was a whole life out there that I was not living.  So I travelled.  I saw France, and Africa, half of South America.  Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.

I'm robbing this place.

Would you mind grabbing that?

Now, I want all of you to lie down.  I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault.

You help my friend, okay?

Sixty.  Eighty.  Four hundred dollars!   Not bad for just the drawers.  Let's see what you got from the vault.

This is it?  The whole vault.

Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.

I should go to Wall Street.  That's where all the money is.

Edward, thank you for the hand!
