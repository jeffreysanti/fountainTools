V.O.
Now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.  Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.

V.O.

V.O.
From that moment on, I no longer feared death.  And for that, I was as good as immortal.
